# GUI for Machine Learning Application

The GUI is made with Python and PyQt5/Qt Designer.

## About the GUI

The GUI primarily contains two independent ML applications merged together:
- Sign language decoder
- Activity tracker and analyzer

The ML side of the application utilizes the Mediapipe API to ensure lightweight application.
